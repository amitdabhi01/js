// Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load).

// if you want to wait for the result of the previous function call before the next statement is executed, you can use a callback function.

// callback is function passed as an argument to another function
// using callback we can do asynchronous task in js
// a callback function it runs after another function has finished
// when you pass functions as an arguments don't use parenthesis

// callback example

function callbackFun(result){
    console.log("The totle of sum is: ", result)
}

function totalSumOfNum(a, b, callbackFun){
    let result = a + b;
    callbackFun(result)
}

totalSumOfNum(10, 20, callbackFun)
